# dev-container-R
 A dev container for my grad school writing workflow

I'm a grad student in the social sciences and over the course of my studies, I've developed a workflow that really works for me. Everything is based on plain text files, markdown, R, Rmarkdown, and pandoc. After fighting a few dependency issues, I wanted to create a stable environment that would perfectly support my workflow. This is my first try.
